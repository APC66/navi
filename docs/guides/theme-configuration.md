# Theme configuration basics

The `config/theme.php` file should be used to configure:

* Navigation menus
* Sidebars
* Theme supports

> [!TIP]
> Coming from a typical Sage setup? This file replaces `app/setup.php`

You will never need to edit anything from the theme directory (`public/content/themes/radicle/`) unless you want to change the name of the theme from Radicle.
